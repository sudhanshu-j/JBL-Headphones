## ✍️ Code Walkthrough

### 📜 HTML (`index.html`)

The HTML file provides the structure of the webpage:

- **Navigation Menu**: Contains a mobile-responsive nav bar with toggle buttons and links.

- **Sections**: Multiple sections (`<section>`) with specific IDs to facilitate smooth scrolling and active link highlighting.

- **Footer**: Contains copyright and social media links related to the JBL headphones brand.

### 🎨 CSS (`style.css`)

The CSS file is used to style the webpage:

- **Responsive Layout**: The layout adjusts for both mobile and desktop views using media queries.

- **Navigation Styling**: The navigation menu has a sliding animation for mobile views.

- **Scroll Effects**: Transitions and animations for elements as the user scrolls.

- **Fixed Positioning**: The header and scroll-up button are fixed to their respective positions for better accessibility.

### 🧑‍💻 JavaScript (`script.js`)

The JavaScript file manages interactivity and animations:

- **Mobile Menu Toggle**: The script controls the opening and closing of the navigation menu based on button clicks.

- **Scroll Events**: Tracks scroll events to add a blur effect to the header and display the scroll-up button.

- **Swiper Carousel**: Initializes the Swiper carousel for a rotating image gallery showcasing JBL headphones.

- **ScrollReveal Animations**: Adds animations to page elements as they come into view during scrolling.
